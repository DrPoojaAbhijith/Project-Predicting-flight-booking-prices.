# Project-Predicting-flight-booking-prices.

Problem Statement:
The objective is to analyze the flight booking dataset obtained from a platform which is used to book flight tickets. A thorough study of the data will aid in the discovery of valuable insights that will be of enormous value to passengers. Apply EDA, statistical methods and Machine learning algorithms in order to get meaningful information from it.

Dataset Information:
Flight booking price prediction dataset contains around 3 lacs records with 11 attributes
